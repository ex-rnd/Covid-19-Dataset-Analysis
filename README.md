# 🦠 Project Overview
COVID-19 data preparation and univariate/correlation analysis notebook
A compact, reproducible demonstration of common data-preparation tasks used in analytics pipelines and model-ready preprocessing applied to a COVID-19 dataset.


### 📋 Purpose
Provide a clear example of loading, cleaning, numeric coercion, descriptive statistics, univariate diagnostics, visualization, and correlation analysis for real-world epidemiological data.


### 📚 Datasets in the Notebook
- COVID-19 CSV (public RAW): contains columns such as Cases, Recovered, Deaths, Tests, and population; loaded directly from a raw GitHub URL and cleaned by dropping missing values.


### 🧰 Core techniques demonstrated
- Data loading: pd.read_csv from a remote URL.
- Missing-value handling: df.dropna() used to produce a clean working table.
- Type correction and coercion: .astype(int) to convert numeric-like columns into integer dtype.
- Central tendency: numpy mean/median and scipy.stats.mode for Cases, Recovered, Deaths.
- Variability measures: range via np.ptp, variance via np.var, standard deviation via np.std.
- Univariate diagnostics and visualization: seaborn/matplotlib histogram and boxplot for population.
- Distribution moments: skew and kurtosis using scipy.stats.
- Outlier inspection: boxplot visual inspection and moment-based indication (skew/kurtosis).
- Correlation analysis: df.corr() and seaborn heatmap for Cases, Recovered, Deaths, Tests, and population.


## ▶️ Usage and Key Cells to Inspect 

### 🧪 Part 1 Data load and initial cleaning
- Load dataset with pd.read_csv(...) and run df.head(), df.info(), df.describe() for an initial snapshot.
- Clean with df = df.dropna() to remove rows with missing values prior to numeric coercion.

### 🧾 Part 2 Central tendencies (Cases, Recovered, Deaths)
- Convert columns to int: df['Cases'].astype(int) etc.
- Compute mean, median, mode using numpy and scipy.stats.mode.
- Print formatted results for each metric.

### 📈 Part 3 Variability (Cases, population, Recovered, Deaths)
- Compute range: np.ptp(column)
- Compute variance: np.var(column)
- Compute standard deviation: np.std(column)
- Print each metric with clear labels.

### 🔍 Part 4 Univariate analysis of population
- Convert population to int and inspect with population.info(), population.describe(), population.value_counts().
- Visualize distribution: sns.histplot(population, bins=10) and sns.boxplot(x=population).
- Compute skew and kurtosis: scipy.stats.skew(population) and scipy.stats.kurtosis(population).
- Interpret skew and kurtosis values to describe symmetry and tail/peakedness.

### 🧭 Part 5 Correlation matrix and inspection
- Build correlation matrix: df[['Cases','Recovered','Deaths','Tests','population']].corr()
- Display matrix and plot heatmap with seaborn; inspect strongest positive/negative relationships.


## 📊 Notes and Findings
### 📌 Central tendencies
- Means, medians, and modes were computed for Cases, Recovered, and Deaths after dtype coercion to integers.

### ⚖️ Variability
- Range, variance, and standard deviation quantify spread for Cases, population, Recovered, and Deaths and highlight which columns have large dispersion that may require transformation or robust summaries.

### 🧾 Population univariate diagnostics
- Histogram and boxplot reveal the overall population distribution and help visually detect extreme values and skew.
- Computed skew and kurtosis provide numeric confirmation of asymmetry and tail characteristics; use these statistics to decide on transformations (log, winsorize) or robust summaries (median, IQR) if needed.

### 🔗 Correlation insights
- Correlation matrix and heatmap show direction and strength of pairwise linear relationships between Cases, Recovered, Deaths, Tests, and population.
- Strong positive correlations between Cases and both Recovered and Deaths indicate expected epidemiological relationships; Tests and population correlations should be interpreted in context (testing intensity, country population differences)


## 🤝 Contributing
### 🚀 Suggested next steps and improvements
- Factor notebook logic into small, testable Python modules under src/ and add unit tests under tests/.
- Replace hardcoded file paths and remote URLs with a small config (YAML/JSON) or CLI argument parsing.
- Add robust file-loading helpers that present clear errors and suggestions if CSVs are missing.
- Expand missing-value handling to selective imputation strategies instead of dropna where appropriate.
- Add visualization diagnostics: additional histogram bins, log-transformed plots, violin plots, pairplots for pairwise distributions.
- Add Z-score based outlier detection and thresholding for reproducible outlier removal when needed.
- Add logging, argument parsing, and small wrappers to run the cleaning/analysis pipeline from the command line.

### 🧭 Style and process
- 	Follow PEP8 for any Python modules and use a pre-commit hook for linting.
- 	Prefer small, well-documented functions rather than large blocks of procedural code inside the notebook.
- 	Tests should call functions in src/ instead of running notebook cells.
